### Greetings, traveler of the digital realms 🧙‍♂️ (Hi there)
I am Anirudh. A scribe of code 💻, a champion in games of skill 🎮, a teller of tales to eager minds 👨‍🏫, and a steadfast supporter of the scarlet chariots of Ferrari 🏎️ (forever shall they have my allegiance). My quill rests often, but when it moves, it is with purpose. A true honour it is to cross paths with you.


### When the forge of code lies quiet... ☕ (My Hobbies)
You might find me wandering new paths of craft and hobby 🧭, poring over the ancient scrolls of tech-lore 📜, partaking in grand campaigns of strategy and wit 🎲, delving into sagas of fiction 📚, or tinkering with artifacts of curious design ⚙️.


### My current quest ⚒️ (What I'm working on)
I am a Master Smith of Software in the great marketplace of Walmart (https://www.walmart.com/) 🛒. I toil with the fellowship of the Runtime Platforms, forging tools and enchanted artifacts to aid the builders and craftsmen across the entire kingdom.


### To send a missive 🐦 (How to reach me)
Should you bear tidings of interest, you may send a raven to anirudhjaishankar97@gmail.com ✉️. I pray you, do not beset my inbox with trivial matters 🚫. My thanks, and may your days be
fair. 🙏
